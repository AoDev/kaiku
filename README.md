## It's WIP

* It works, if you have proper tags on your files.
* At the moment I'm doing the bare minimum to suite my needs.
* Feel free to open an issue if you are interested.
* There is no downloadable version at the moment. You can clone the repo and run it locally.

## Why

It's 2025, kids probably don't know what an mp3 is and there are great online services. So...?

Well, I like to manage my music.

**It's a rewrite**

I'm rewriting this [music player](https://github.com/AoDev/kaiku-music-player) I made many years ago. It stopped working when I switched to an Apple Silicon computer. I'm using this as an opportunity to try some new things.
