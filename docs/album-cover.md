## When should I search for albums covers?

- When the list of albums displayed in the library changes
  - Changes when: filter changes or artist selected changes

  Can not observe list of albums displayed because an update of cover will trigger an infinite loop.

- When a song is played
  - Changes when music player song changes
    - When automatically switching to next song
    - When manually switching to next or previous song

- Manual refresh (later)
